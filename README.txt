How to compile and run:
1) navigate to the folder where my project is stored using terminal
2) Enter "javac FractalDrawer.java" java into the terminal
3) Enter "java FractalDrawer" into the terminal

Any assumptions:
none

Additional Features:
- if the user does not enter either a triangle, circle, or rectangle it will keep prompting them until they do.
- the input uses .toLower() to properly capture all inputs
- created 3 new colors to use in my fractals

Known Defects:
- the circle fractal is so large that it has trouble rendering - resizing my canvas window a few times helped it render

Outside sources:
- how to create custom colors using java.awt.Color rgb values
